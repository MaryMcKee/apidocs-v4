# Overview

The PokitDok API allows you to perform X12 transactions, schedule appointments
into a number of EMRs, as well as search our curated databases of healthcare
providers, procedure pricing, medical procedure codes, and more. The API is
designed according to REST (Representational State Transfer) principles. The
API uses JavaScript Object Notation ([JSON](http://json.org/)) for requests
and responses, and also allows batch processing of [ASC X12](http://x12.org/)
5010 compatible [EDI](http://www.x12.org/about/faqs.cfm#a1) files. All API
traffic is encrypted over HTTPS and authentication is handled with OAuth2.
